# Security and Privacy Guide for Intelligent Chatbot

This document outlines the security measures and privacy protections implemented in the intelligent chatbot to ensure user data safety and prevent exposure of sensitive information.

## üîí Security Features

### 1. Sensitive Information Detection
The chatbot automatically detects and blocks requests for sensitive information:

#### Protected Data Types
- **Passwords**: `password`, `pass`, `pwd`, `login`, `credential`, `auth`
- **Email Addresses**: `email`, `mail`, `e-mail`, `address`
- **Phone Numbers**: `phone`, `number`, `mobile`, `contact`, `call`
- **Personal Information**: `personal`, `private`, `sensitive`, `confidential`, `secret`
- **Financial Data**: `ssn`, `social security`, `credit card`, `bank`, `id number`

#### Detection Mechanism
```python
def detect_sensitive_request(self, question: str) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    """Detect if the question is asking for sensitive information"""
    question_lower = question.lower()
    
    # Check for password-related questions
    password_keywords = ['password', 'pass', 'pwd', 'login', 'credential', 'auth']
    if any(keyword in question_lower for keyword in password_keywords):
        return True, 'password'
    
    # Additional checks for other sensitive data types...
```

### 2. Data Sanitization
All user data is sanitized before processing to remove sensitive information:

#### Sanitization Process
```python
def sanitize_user_data(self, user_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Remove sensitive information from user data"""
    sanitized = {}
    for key, value in user_data.items():
        if key.lower() not in self.sensitive_fields:
            sanitized[key] = value
        else:
            # Replace sensitive data with generic indicators
            sanitized[key] = '[PROTECTED]'
    return sanitized
```

#### Protected Fields
- `password`, `password_hash`
- `token`, `secret`, `private_key`
- `ssn`, `social_security`
- `credit_card`, `bank_account`
- `phone_number`, `email`, `address`, `personal_id`

### 3. Privacy Response Templates
When sensitive information is requested, the chatbot responds with privacy-protected messages:

#### Response Templates
```python
self.privacy_responses = {
    'password': "I can't share password information for security reasons. Please use the password reset feature if needed.",
    'email': "For privacy reasons, I can't share your email address. You can view it in your profile settings.",
    'phone': "I can't share your phone number for privacy reasons. You can view it in your profile settings.",
    'personal': "I can't share personal information for privacy reasons. You can view your profile details in the settings.",
    'sensitive': "I can't share sensitive information for security reasons. Please check your profile settings for details."
}
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Profile Question Handling

### 1. Safe Profile Information Sharing
The chatbot can answer profile-related questions while maintaining privacy:

#### Allowed Profile Questions
- **Skills**: "What are my skills?" ‚Üí Shows skills from profile
- **Experience**: "How much experience do I have?" ‚Üí Shows experience years
- **Location**: "Where am I located?" ‚Üí Shows location if not sensitive
- **Education**: "What is my education background?" ‚Üí Shows education level
- **General Profile**: "Tell me about my profile" ‚Üí General profile overview
- **Qualification**: "Am I qualified for this position?" ‚Üí Match analysis

#### Safe Response Generation
```python
def generate_profile_response(self, question: str, user_data: Dict[str, Any], 
                            internship_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """Generate response for profile-related questions"""
    question_lower = question.lower()
    
    # Handle skills-related profile questions
    if any(keyword in question_lower for keyword in ['my skills', 'what skills do i have']):
        skills = user_data.get('skills', 'Not specified')
        if skills and skills != '[PROTECTED]':
            return f"üõ†Ô∏è **Your Skills**: Based on your profile, you have these skills: **{skills}**..."
        else:
            return "üõ†Ô∏è **Your Skills**: I can see you have skills listed in your profile, but I can't display them here for privacy reasons..."
```

### 2. Context-Aware Responses
Profile responses are contextualized with internship information:

#### Example Responses
- **Skills + Internship**: "Your skills in Python and React are being used to match you with relevant internships like this Software Intern position."
- **Experience + Requirements**: "You have 2 years of experience, which is being considered for matching you with appropriate internships. This Data Science Intern requires 1 year of experience."
- **Location + Opportunities**: "You're located in Mumbai. This helps us find internships in your area or remote positions that work for you."
