# Intelligent Chatbot with Transformer Architecture

This document describes the implementation of an intelligent chatbot for the InternGenie application that uses transformer architecture and attention mechanisms to understand user questions and provide contextual responses about internships.

##  Architecture Overview

The intelligent chatbot is built using a mini-LLM (Large Language Model) approach with the following components:

### 1. Transformer Architecture
- **Multi-Head Attention**: 8 attention heads for understanding complex relationships in user questions
- **Positional Encoding**: Captures the order and position of words in questions
- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Processes attention outputs for better understanding
- **Layer Normalization**: Stabilizes training and improves performance

### 2. Context-Aware Embeddings
- **User Context**: Encodes user profile data (skills, experience, location, education)
- **Internship Context**: Encodes internship details (requirements, company, location, stipend)
- **Contextual Fusion**: Combines user and internship contexts for personalized responses

### 3. Intent Classification
The chatbot can understand and classify 10 different types of user intents:
- `location_question`: Questions about internship location
- `skills_question`: Questions about required skills
- `stipend_question`: Questions about compensation
- `duration_question`: Questions about internship duration
- `match_question`: Questions about user-internship compatibility
- `company_question`: Questions about the company
- `application_question`: Questions about the application process
- `improvement_question`: Questions about improving chances
- `general_question`: General questions about the internship
- `greeting`: Greeting and introductory messages

## üöÄ Features

### Intelligent Understanding
- **Semantic Analysis**: Uses transformer attention to understand question meaning beyond keywords
- **Context Integration**: Considers both user profile and internship details
- **Intent Recognition**: Automatically classifies user intent with confidence scores
- **Personalized Responses**: Tailors responses based on user's specific situation

### Advanced Response Generation
- **Template-Based Generation**: Uses intelligent templates with dynamic content insertion
- **Contextual Enhancement**: Adds relevant details based on user and internship context
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for response accuracy
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Falls back to rule-based responses if AI fails

### Visual Indicators
- **AI-Powered Badge**: Shows when responses are generated by the intelligent system
- **Intent Labels**: Displays detected intent with confidence percentage
- **Attention Visualization**: Shows which parts of the question received most attention

## üîß Implementation Details

### Backend Components

#### 1. IntelligentChatbot Class
```python
class IntelligentChatbot(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, d_model=256, num_heads=8, num_layers=6):
        # Transformer architecture with attention mechanisms
```

#### 2. Multi-Head Attention
```python
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads, dropout=0.1):
        # Implements scaled dot-product attention
```

#### 3. Context Processing
```python
class ContextProcessor:
    def encode_user_context(self, user_data):
        # Converts user profile to numerical features
    
    def encode_internship_context(self, internship_data):
        # Converts internship details to numerical features
```

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Enhanced Message Interface
```typescript
interface Message {
  id: string
  type: 'user' | 'bot'
  content: string
  intent?: string
  confidence?: number
  isIntelligent?: boolean
}
```

#### 2. Intelligent Response Generation
```typescript
const generateAIResponse = async (question: string) => {
  // Tries intelligent chatbot first, falls back to rule-based
  const intelligentResponse = await api.chatWithBot(question, internshipId)
  return formatIntelligentResponse(intelligentResponse, recommendation)
}
```

## üéØ API Endpoints

### 1. Chat with Bot
```http
POST /chatbot/chat
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "question": "What skills do I need?",
  "internship_id": 123
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "For this Software Intern position, you need: Python, JavaScript, React...",
  "intent": "skills_question",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "attention_weights": [[0.1, 0.3, 0.2, ...]]
}
```

### 2. Train Chatbot
```http
POST /chatbot/train
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Chatbot training completed successfully",
  "model_path": "intelligent_chatbot_model.pth"
}
```

### 3. Get Chatbot Status
```http
GET /chatbot/status
```

```json
{
  "status": "active",
  "vocab_size": 10000,
  "model_loaded": true,
  "intent_labels": ["location_question", "skills_question", ...]
}
```

## üöÄ Usage
